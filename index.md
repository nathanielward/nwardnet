# Hi there. I'm Nat Ward.

Thereâ€™s not much on this site. You can read a few of my scribblings elsewhere, though.

## Three things to know about me

1. I'm an online marketer and fundraiser who uses experimentation to understand donors and improve outcomes;
2. I speak regularly about online marketing and optimization, including at the MECLABS Optimization Summit, the Direct Marketing Association Nonprofit Conference, and the Koch Associates Program; and
3. In my spare time, I work to make cities better and people freer.

## How to get in touch

Drop me a line on Twitter: [@nathanielward][1]

Or since you probably stalked me through my email address, send me a note that way.
